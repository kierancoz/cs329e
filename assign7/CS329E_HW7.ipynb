    "  - AdaBoost, and\n",
    "  - Random Forests\n",

    "Along with applying different KPIs (key performance indicators) that are more appropriate to highly skewed data sets. \n",

    "The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.\n",
    "This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 237 frauds out of 142,167 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.17% of all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a [PCA transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount in Euros. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this homework, I expect you to understand how to train and use ensemble classifiers, how to characterize model performance with ROC curves, and be familiar with the difference between accuracy, true positive rate, and positive predictive value. "
